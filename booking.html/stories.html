    <h3>1.Adivasi cuisine</h3>
    <p>The unexplored culinary traditions of India's tribal culture, if exposed and adopted could turn our tech driven lifestyle into a healthy, self-sufficient and a minimalistic one. The tribal cuisine is simple and rich in nutrition. The Dhurwa tribe of Chhatisgarh relishes chutneys made of red ants, the tribals of Assam gorge onto Eri Polu (stir fried silk worms), the Naga tribes can't get over pork cooked with fermented bamboo shoots with Jolokia chillies and the tribal belt of Jharkhand has contributed the delicious Dhuska (fried pancakes made of lentils and rice) to our Indian cuisine.</p>
